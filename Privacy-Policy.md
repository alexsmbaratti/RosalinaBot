# Privacy Policy
Privacy is important more than ever, so this document outlines the data collection methods used by 
RosalinaBot. Note that this document will only cover data collection by RosalinaBot, and is not inclusive
of data collection policies of separate entities such as Discord, any Discord server, or other bots in the same server as RosalinaBot.

RosalinaBot will never sell your personal information.

## Collection of Friend Codes and Related Data
The headlining feature of RosalinaBot is to keep track of and store friend codes. Friend codes are stored 
for the purpose of storing them for later retrieval at a user's request. A friend code is only saved when the user 
explicitly issues a command to save such data. 

Any mention of the term "friend code" in this policy may include, but is not limited to:
* Nintendo Switch Friend Codes
* Nintendo 3DS Friend Codes
* Animal Crossing: New Horizons Island Names
* Pok√©mon Go Friend Codes
* Fire Emblem Heroes Friend Codes
* Super Mario Odyssey Balloon World Codes

Information like the above is stored in a database, tied to a specific user. That user is logged using their
Discord user ID, which is a unique string of numbers. 

Only Nintendo Switch Friend Codes and Nintendo 3DS Friend Codes can be hidden from public retrieval. Other
users in the same server as both you and RosalinaBot will be able to request your non-hidden friend codes. 
All friend codes are public by default. 

Aggregated, anonymous data is logged for the purpose of research and development. For example, this may be used
for displaying the amount of Nintendo Switch Friend Codes stored versus the amount of Nintendo 3DS Friend Codes stored. 

Interacting with RosalinaBot may cause your Discord user ID to be logged in the database with no other information. 

All personal data in the database can be removed from RosalinaBot's database at any time by using the r!clear command.

## Logged Data
Some data is temporarily logged in a console for the purposes of debugging. This data may include 
Discord user IDs. An example log may be "Nintendo Switch Friend Code saved for 11111!". This can help
with direct support requests. 

## Security
No form of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and the possibility of a data breach is always
possible. As a result, security cannot be guaranteed and this risk must be known to the user.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy may be changed at any time without prior notice. This current policy is effective as of July 1, 2020.
