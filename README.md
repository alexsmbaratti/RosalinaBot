## Instructions
### Sharing friend codes
To share your friend code with people in your server, or just keep it handy on Discord, use either `r!switchCode` or `r!3DSCode` to store your Nintendo Switch friend code or Nintendo 3DS friend code respectively. Example usage is below for both commands.

`r!switchCode SW-1234-5678-9000`
`r!3DSCode 1234-5678-9000`

Note that dashes are required and the commands are not case sensitive. You should receive a confirmation message if it is successful. By default, your friend codes are public. In order for others to see them, you must type `r!switchCode` or `r!3DSCode` to retrieve your friend codes. If you set your friend codes to public, others in a server with RosalinaBot may use `r!switchCode @[YOU]` or `r!3DSCode @[YOU]` to retrieve your friend codes.

### Privacy Settings
By default, any of your friend codes will be set to public. The only time RosalinaBot will send your friend codes to a chat is if you and only you use the `r!switchCode` or the `r!3DSCode` commands. To check these settings at anytime, use `r!settings`.

To change a privacy setting, follow this format `r!settings [PLATFORM]Code [PRIVACY]`. Replace `PLATFORM` with either `switch` or `3DS` and `PRIVACY` with either `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`. For example, typing `r!settings switchCode PUBLIC` will set your Nintendo Switch friend code to public. Likewise, typing `r!settings 3DSCode PRIVATE` will set your Nintendo 3DS friend code to private.

### Sharing Balloon World codes
You can share your Balloon World codes from Super Mario Odyssey using `r!smo`. The basic structure for saving a code is `r!smo [KINGDOM] 000000000`. `[KINGDOM]` should be replaced with one of the following:
* cap
* cascade
* sand
* lake
* wooded
* lost
* metro
* snow
* seaside
* luncheon
* bowser
* moon
* mushroom

Balloon World codes do not have privacy settings. They are public for other members to see. You can view another person's code by using `r!smo [KINGDOM] @[MENTION]`
